# LightVoice
LightVoice is a robust and lightweight real-time voice communication program made using Python.

## Dependencies (Required, they are installed by default)
- socket (Required to start the server)
- pyaudio (Required to broadcast/send the audio)
- threading (Required so it'd support multiple clients)

## Story
While I was using Discord with a friend, I told him one million time there's a dude behind the wall before he entered, he told me I told him too late, I was like NO, I told you before you went, and we noticed we had a voice delay, so I made this program.
